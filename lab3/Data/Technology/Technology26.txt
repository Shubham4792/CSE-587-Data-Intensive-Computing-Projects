It is no secret that North Korea’s military ambitions include building an intercontinental missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to the United States. What isn’t as well known is what the United States has been doing to thwart that ambition.In a startling story, The New York Times’s David E. Sanger and William J. Broad detail a three-year cyberwar quietly waged against North Korea’s missile program.

Others have grown increasingly skeptical of the approach.The big news over the weekend was President Trump’s early-morning tweets asserting — without providing any evidence — that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump’s phones during the presidential election.

Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Mr. Trump’s assertion.On Monday morning, the South Korean military reported that North Korea had fired four ballistic missiles from its long-range rocket launch site. The missiles, an indication of the North’s growing capacity, appeared to have fallen into the sea near Japan.The rest of the world, it seems, is not waiting for Washington’s drama to play itself out.
