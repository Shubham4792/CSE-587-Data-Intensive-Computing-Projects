(Reuters) - Beauty products maker Coty Inc on Wednesday posted better-than-expected quarterly results, selling more of a range of luxury perfumes which include Burberry and Gucci brands.Once a pure-play fragrance maker, Coty has diversified by acquiring a slew of established brands and adding hair appliances and Younique makeup to its portfolio of products to attract younger customers.Powered by strong growth in designer brands including Chloe and Tiffany & Co, sales in its luxury beauty segment climbed 19 percent to $752.5 million (554 million pounds) in the third quarter ended March 31.Shares in the company rose 6.3 percent to $16.90 in response to the results.Chief Executive Officer Camillo Pane told Reuters that prior to the relaunch of a series of its products in January this year, sales of its CoverGirl makeup and skincare faced double-digit declines. Wednesday's results showed a low single-digit percentage fall."The overall Clairol business is not showing big signs of improvement," said Pane, as it faces a stagnant beauty market in the U.S. and competition from Lâ€™Oreal and ELF Cosmetics.Pane said he expects modest organic net revenue growth in the second half of 2018.Net loss attributable to Coty Inc narrowed to $77 million or 10 cents per share, from a loss of $164.2 million or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.Coty reported a drop of about 73 percent in restructuring costs in the quarter.Excluding certain items, the company earned 13 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales rose 9.4 percent to $2.22 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $2.17 billion.
