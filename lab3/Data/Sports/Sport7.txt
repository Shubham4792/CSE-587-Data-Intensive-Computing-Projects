"We had enough scoring chances to win this game but they had a great goaltending and the way they played was hard for us to beat today."Finland outshot Denmark 35-17.After a goalless opening period, Frans Nielsen broke the deadlock, giving the hosts the lead in Herning 2:28 into the second. Aho answered two minutes later but Oliver Bjorkstrand restored the surprise lead again. Captain Mikael Granlund equalized for Finland in the third but Nichlas Hardt scored the winner with 1:59 left.

"Hopefully, we can build on that."Brock Radunske scored for South Korea at 6-0 in only the second goal for the Koreans at the tournament."If we can get a couple guys score, that's kind of snowball, picks up the confidence for everybody on the team," Radunske said. "Next games are not gonna get any easier, it's top countries, top players in the world. We just have to use it as a learning experience."Radunske said South Korea, which has lost all four games so far, wants to show in the rest of the tournament that "we deserve to be in this division."Joel Vermin put Switzerland 3-2 up against Belarus with his second goal in the second period before Enzo Corvi and Timo Meier sealed the victory in the final period in Copenhagen.After losing its first three games, Belarus replaced coach Dave Lewis with assistant coach Sergei Pushkov but that change has yet to boost Belarus.
